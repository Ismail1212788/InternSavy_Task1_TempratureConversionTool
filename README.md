A temperature conversion tool in Java is a handy utility that enables users to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius scales effortlessly. This tool is particularly useful for anyone who needs to work with temperature data in different units or for individuals looking to understand temperature values in a more familiar scale. Here, I'll describe the key components and functionalities of such a tool.

User Interface:
The temperature conversion tool typically has a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with it easily. This interface can be implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) with input fields and auto calculate on input

Conversion Formulas:
The core of the temperature conversion tool lies in the conversion formulas. There are two primary temperature scales involved: Fahrenheit (°F) and Celsius (°C). The conversion formulas are as follows:

    Fahrenheit to Celsius: Celsius (°C) = (Fahrenheit (°F) - 32) * 5/9

    Celsius to Fahrenheit: Fahrenheit (°F) = (Celsius (°C) * 9/5) + 32
